# Claude Code Rules for Proto Project

**This file is now deprecated. All project rules, best practices, and memory are consolidated in [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).**

The `AGENTS.md` file at the root of the project is tool-agnostic and can be used by:
- Claude Code (via `.claude/claude.md`)
- Cursor (via `.cursor/rules/agents.mdc`)
- Any other AI coding assistant

Please refer to `AGENTS.md` for the complete and up-to-date project documentation.
